# FBI Firearm Data Analysis
This is a project based on the data from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System and the State level data from Census.gov.The orignal data can be found with files named 'gun_data.csv' and 'us.census data.csv'.

In the project, we will try to answer questions by investigate the above data sets:

1. What's the general trend of the firearms sale in United States in both national level and State level, and we will try to identify the states with the highest growth in gun registration from 1988 to 2016.
2. What kind of characteristics are associated with states that have high gun per capita? We will exam this part of the question from two different perspectives: state population composition and economics.
